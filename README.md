- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Fanhong Meng, a passionate data engineer and software developer.
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in deal with data from different kinds of businesses or industies to build real-world application

Here are some example projects that I did:

1. Database project

2. Machine learning project
    We tested and compared five supervised machine learning algorithms including Decision tree, Support Vector Machine, Neural Network, Ada Boosting and k-   
    Nearest Neighbors on two classification tasks.


    1) The first classification task is a classical application of machine learning in the real word, which is to evaluate if the email contains spam content 
       based on its body text.

    2) The second one is a little bit more complicated comparing to the first one, which is the sentimental analysis of the restaurant review, more specifically, 
       it identifies the customerâ€™s attitude to the restaurant (positive or negative) given their comment.
