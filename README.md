👋 Hi, I’m Fanhong Meng, a passionate data engineer and software developer.
👀 I’m interested in deal with data from different kinds of businesses or industies to build real-world application

Here are some example projects that I did:

1. Database project

2. Text classfication applications
    We tested and compared five supervised machine learning algorithms including Decision tree, Support Vector Machine, Neural Network, Ada Boosting and k-   
    Nearest Neighbors on two classification tasks.

    1) The first classification task is a classical application of machine learning in the real word, which is to evaluate if the email contains spam content 
       based on its body text.

    2) The second one is a little bit more complicated comparing to the first one, which is the sentimental analysis of the restaurant review, more specifically, 
       it identifies the customer’s attitude to the restaurant (positive or negative) given their comment.
